## Abstract
We present a description of the large scale physical oceanography of the southeast Indian Ocean to provide context for this special issue on revisiting 110 &deg;E as part of the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition. Full watermass properties and circulation are introduced based on the hydrographic observations, as well as underway systems and satellite sea surface height measurements. The 110 &deg;E line provides a window into the global meridional overturning circulation and the shallow overturning of the Indian Ocean. Comparison with the 1963 transect will be undertaken in future work to document the 60 year change and explore the physical mechanisms that have driven the change.
